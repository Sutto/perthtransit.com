# PerthTransit.com

This is the web app frontend to [The Transperth API](https://github.com/sutto/transperth-api) that I built.

It's intended to be consumed by mobile devices (e.g. iPhone / Android).

Note - This app is rails only so that we can have sprockets and everything nicely tied together (e.g. helpers).

This application does not require activerecord etc.
